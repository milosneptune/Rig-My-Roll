### High Concept
Rig my roll is a slot machine rouge-like where you can rig your slot rolls with upgrades and items. The player's objective is to reach the end of round and meet a score requirement in order to progress to the next, if they fail, they must restart from the beginning. The core mechanic that allows players to progress and reach higher scores is the item usage. By using items wisely, the player can exceed the score requirement and gain additional bonuses.
